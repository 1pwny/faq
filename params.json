If two ops disagree, the remaining op can cast the deciding vote for the short term, and the members of the channel can vote to deteremine long term decisions. We don't want to actually have this happen, so ops should work to reach a decision on their own. \r\n\r\n## Bots\r\nLog in with password \"backtickbots:MwT7v3Cmsa\" and test in ##\\`bots. Please don't spam #\\`.\r\n\r\n## QuoteDB\r\nSee [nkf1's site](http://me.zippynk.com/backtick_irc_qdb.txt).\r\n\r\n## IRC Topic\r\nThe topic is settable by anybody but you should not delete the link to the faq in it and should be respectful of other people who change the topic.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
