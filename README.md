#\` FAQ

## History
On the eve of creation, __#\`__ sprang into creation, straight from a `git init` by Linus Torvalds. Raised by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, the inhabitants of __#`__ were trained at an early age in the art of bug fighting by Grace Hopper and Alan Turing. Because of these tumultuous and often times violent beginings, __#`__ was left bereft of true spiritual nourshiment. Yet, after tormented eons, the arrival of Randall Monrue, Richard Stallman, and Donal Trump began to heal the metaphysical wounds of __#`__. This healing has only begun recentely, and it remains to be seen how far __#`__ can go on the road of recovery. It has not been easy, but with the help of xkcd,  St. IGNUcius, and the Donald, __#`__ has gotten to where it is now. At least, I think that's how it happened. It's pretty late, so I might be getting a bit confused.

## Political System
The three ops (__JacobEdelman__, __tb10__, __nickolas360__) decide matters relating to kicking, banning, ect. If two ops disagree, the remaining op can cast the deciding vote for the short term, and the members of the channel can vote to deteremine long term decisions. We don't want to actually have this happen, so ops should work to reach a decision on their own. 

## Bots
Test in __##\`bots__ and ask __nickolas360__ for the bot password for __#\`__. Please don't spam __#\`__.
