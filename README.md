## Discussion Rules

## Political System
The three ops (__JacobEdelman__, __tb10__, __nickolas360__) decide matters
relating to kicking, banning, etc. If two ops disagree, the remaining op can
cast the deciding vote for the short term, and the members of the channel can
vote to determine long term decisions. We don't want to actually have this
happen, so ops should work to reach a decision on their own.

## Bots
Test bots in __##\`bots__. If you'd like to launch a bot on __#\`__, log in
with the account (not nickname) `backtickbots` and ask __nickolas360__ for the
password. If you're using **[pyrcb](https://github.com/nickolas360/pyrcb)**,
call `IRCBot.password("backtickbots:<password>")` right after calling
`IRCBot.connect()`.

## QuoteDB

## IRC Topic
The topic is settable by anybody but you should not delete the link to the faq
in it and should be respectful of other people who change the topic.

## History
On the eve of creation, __#\`__ sprang into creation, straight from a `git
init` by Linus Torvalds. Raised by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, the
inhabitants of __#`__ were trained at an early age in the art of bug fighting
by Grace Hopper and Alan Turing. Because of these tumultuous and often times
violent beginnings, __#`__ was left bereft of true spiritual nourishment. Yet,
after tormented eons, the arrival of Randall Monroe, Richard Stallman, and
Donald Trump began to heal the metaphysical wounds of __#`__. This healing has
only begun recently, and it remains to be seen how far __#`__ can go on the
road of recovery. It has not been easy, but with the help of xkcd,  St.
IGNUcius, and the Donald, __#`__ has gotten to where it is now. At least, I
think that's how it happened. It's pretty late, so I might be getting a bit
confused.
